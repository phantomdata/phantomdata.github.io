After some system re-architecture and moving around a bunch of my web-apps,
I realized that I had left my personal site to languish for a very long time.
In fact, I had left it alone for so long that I forgot about spinning down
my EC2 instance and panicked thinking my domain had been hijacked.

Thankfully all was well and I had simply never put anything new up in its place.
I'm hoping to get back into publishing technical articles over the coming months
and hopefully regain a purpose for my personal domain.

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
